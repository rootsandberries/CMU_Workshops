In addition, while some interesting data management standards have been proposed (e.g. BIDS), the tools for an end user to easily go from raw DICOM data to meet this format are lacking. Similarly, the technical knowledge necessary for version control systems, and a lack of formal programming training in most neuroimaging-centric PhD programs create significant hurdles to individuals who may want to adopt more standardized practices but lack the knowledge or local expertise to do so."
