### Exercise 3 Create a new component

### Exercise 6 Make changes and access previous version
* Open the file 'Borghi\_VanGulick\_2018\_data.csv' from your Workshop Files folder on your computer.
* Delete the first two columns and save without changing the file name.
* Replace the file in your data component with the new version by dragging and dropping or uploading to the Data component OSF storage, where the previous version is located.
* Click on the file to view in the project window.  Note this is now Version 2. 
* Click on Revisions in the upper righthand corner. Download version 1 to your computer.

### Exercise 7 Connect an add-on of your choice
*  OSF allows you to connect with multiple add-on tools for storage and citation management such as GitHub, Google Drive and Mendeley.
* Go to [http://help.osf.io/m/addons](http://help.osf.io/m/addons). Choose an add-on from the list that you typically use and  follow OSF's step-by-step instructions to connect it to the project.
* We'll be on hand to troubleshoot as you work through the steps.
