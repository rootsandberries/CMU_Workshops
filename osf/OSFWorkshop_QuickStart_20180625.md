###Getting Started with Open Science Framework
####Quick Start Guide
---#####Description of OSF:* Free and open source tool created by the non-profit Center for Open Science.* Built for managing the entire research workflow.* Manage multiple projects through one dashboard.* Projects can be private, collaborative, or public.* Can sync with popular third-party applications such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, Amazon S3, GitHub, figshare, Mendeley, and Zotero.#####Getting Started with OSF:	* Create an account at: [https://osf.io](https://osf.io)* To use the Getting Started with OSF template for your project:
	- Search for “CMU Getting Started with OSF Demo” at [https://osf.io/search/](https://osf.io/search/).
	- Click on the fork button in the right corner of the project and select “Duplicate Template” from the dropdown.•	To create a new project from scratch, click on the green “Create New Project” button.#####Collaboration:* You can add collaborators (called “contributors” on OSF) to your project. * If contributors don’t have an OSF account, they can be added as an unregistered contributor.* Contributors can have administrator, read and write, or read only privileges.#####Structure of OSF projects:* •	An OSF project can be used to manage an individual project or a line of research.* You can create components to provide structure for the project. Components can be nested.	- Each component can have its own privacy and contributor settings.* Each component and the top-level project has OSF storage. Files can be uploaded into OSF storage using the Upload buttons. 	- Folders can be created to give files more organization.* An unlimited number of files (under 5 GB each) can be stored in OSF storage. * Each component or the top-level project can have add-on third-party applications.#####Privacy:* Projects and components will always default to private, meaning that only you and your designated contributors can see the content.* If you want to make a project public, you can choose a license (default is CC0 1.0 Universal). * If you want your project as a whole to be sharable and citable, you can create a DOI for it. 	- If you want individual research products such as a data set or publication to be publicly shared and citable, talk to us about the CMU repository, [KiltHub (https://kilthub.figshare.com/)](https://kilthub.figshare.com/).#####Version Control:* Versioning will be triggered by:	- Uploading a new version of a document with the same filename from your computer
	- Editing a file directly in OSF* To see versions of a file, click on Files in the Dashboard Menu and see the version column.#####For Help:* Contact CMU's OSF Coordinators Melanie Gainey [mgainey@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:mgainey@andrew.cmu.edu) or Ana Van Gulick [aev@cmu.ed](mailto:aev@cmu.edu).* Refer to [library.cmu.edu/OSF](https://library.cmu.edu/OSF/) or [guides.library.cmu.edu/OSF](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/OSF). for help creating a project and to see sample projects and watch video tutorials.* View the project used in this demo at [https://osf.io/bep3k/](https://osf.io/bep3k/).
